# The RAM Eater

A huge modpack that tries to encompass as many mods as possible while maintaining a semi-stable play experience. As the name implies, it eats your RAM, and by virtue, you need at LEAST 7-8GB of RAM that you can allocate to the game for this pack. You might be able to play with less, I just recommend that amount for the smoothest possible experience.


This pack draws some inspiration from All The Mods 3, however, we don't try to really balance it out as they have. Eventually, we will be opening up the config source to the public on Github, so if you see something that needs balanced or a rework, that'll go there.


At this time, the pack is EXTREMELY temperamental as I figure out which mods can go into this, already I've had to disable Thaumcraft (though I'll be trying my best to resolve that). Keep that in mind, and use the pack with caution.
